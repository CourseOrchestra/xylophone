[[general-information]]
== General Information

https://github.com/CourseOrchestra/xylophone[Xylophone] provides reports with a complex structure
in forms of spreadsheets (XLS or XLSX format), PDF files or direct output
for printing based on the XML input data. It can be used as command line tool and as a Java library.

The system has two separate XML parsing modes: DOM and SAX.
The DOM mode allows for greater flexibility in defining the structure of
the input data and the XML data reading with greater memory and
computational resource requirements as a cost. The SAX mode introduces a
few insignificant limitations on the XML file structure and on the
reports descriptor, though it outperforms XML mode both memory
consumption and performance wise and therefore is suitable for
generating huge reports.

Xylophone does not require Microsoft Excel or Adobe Acrobat installation as
well as any other software on the machine employed. The system utilizes
the following open source projects as dependencies:

* https://poi.apache.org/[Apache POI] — used in parsing and creation of
Excel-compatible data.
* https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/[Apache FOP] — used in PDF creation
and printing output.

The general system’s data flow is showcased on the diagram:

image::Xml2spreadsheet.png[]

The system’s input accepts:

* XML file with the source data.
* .XLS or .XSLX template which defines the layout and format of the
output document.
* YAML descriptor designating the input data traversal.

The output of the system is a file featuring the file extension and
format corresponding to the input template (.XLS in case the template was .XLS or
.XSLX otherwise). Further, the output XLS may be forwarded to the next
stage and converted into a PDF file or sent directly for printing.

== Phase One: Producing XLS and XLSX Files

[[system-usage]]
=== System Usage

There are two ways to use the Xylophone:

* usage as a command-line tool.
* Usage as a Java library.

[[usage-as-a-command-line-tool]]
==== Usage As a Command-line Tool

To use as a command line tool, unzip the “xylophone-VERSION-bin.zip”.
This archive contains folders named “lib” and “bin”. The “bin” folder
contains shell scripts for launching in Windows and Linux environment.

Execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
xylophone -data datafile.xml -template template.xls[x] \
  -descr descriptor.yaml -out result.xls [-sax] [-copytemplate]
----

where

* datafile.xml — a file with the source XML data
* template.xls[x] — a template with XLS or XLSX format
* descriptor.yaml — configuration file (previously mentioned as
“descriptor”)
* result.xls — output file name. Its file extension determines the
output format, XLS or XLSX
* sax — presence of this parameter defines if SAX parsing mode is to be
used (more information below)
* copytemplate — presence of this parameter defines if the template will
be copied entirely to result with all of the contents present before the process.

[[usage-as-a-library]]
==== Usage As a Library

To use Xylophone as the library you need to import
`ru.curs.xylophone.XML2Spreadsheet` class and call its static method
called `process`: `XML2Spredsheet.process(...)`. There are several
overloaded versions of this method with the following parameters.

* File/InputStream *xmlData* — source data.
* File/InputStream *yamlDescriptor* — descriptor data, describing the
order of data iteration.
* File/InputStream *template* — the report template.
* ru.curs.flute.xml2spreadsheet.OutputType *outputType* — report
template type (OpenOffice, XLS, XLSX). _This argument is omitted if the
arguments xmlData, yamlDescriptor, template are of type File. In such
case, the value of the argument is deduced by the template’s file
extension._
* boolean *useSAX* — parsing mode, DOM if false, SAX if true, the
differences are listed below.
* boolean *copyTemplate* — should the template be copied prior to data
emission. _Optional argument, false by default._ The option is used if
the existing contents of the templates need to be transferred to the
output. For instance, existing diagrams, graphics, and other things.
* OutputStream *output* — the output stream which the system’s output
will be written into.

Additionally there is the *XML2Spreadsheet.toPOIWorkbook(xmlData,
yamlDescriptor, template, useSAX, copyTemplate)* method, which returns an
instance of org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Workbook, serving an
object-based report representation. This method will be useful in cases
where a report is to go through additional post-processing step prior to
serialization.

Groovy example (try out this https://github.com/inponomarev/xylophone-example[demo project]):


[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('ru.curs:xylophone:6.1.9')
import ru.curs.xylophone.XML2Spreadsheet
baseDir = '.'
new File(baseDir, 'testdata.xml').withInputStream {
    input ->
        new File(baseDir, 'report.xlsx').withOutputStream {
            output ->
                XML2Spreadsheet.process(input,
                        new File(baseDir, 'descriptor.yaml'),
                        new File(baseDir, 'template.xlsx'),
                        false, output)
        }
}
println 'Done.'

[[controlled-xml-traversal]]
=== Controlled XML Traversal

Output to a spreadsheet document goes as follows:

* the system traverses the elements (tags) in the XML data file in a
specific way (the traverse algorithm is controlled by the XML
configuration file or a _descriptor file_),
* at the specified moments the template fragments are copied to the
resulting document; the template data fields are filled with information
in the context of the current element in the XML data file.

While traversing an XML data file the system can assume one of the three
modes:

1.  Element reading mode
2.  Output mode
3.  Iteration mode

The mode transition graph:

[plantuml, diagram-state, png]
....
[*] --> element : process root element
element --> iteration : process child elements
iteration --> element
element --> output
output --> element
element --> [*] : finish root element processing
....


The description of the XML data file traversal via the description of
three possible modes is below.

[[element-reading-mode]]
==== Element Reading Mode

When processing starts, the system sets the root element in the data
document as current context and switches to the element reading mode. At
the beginning of processing, the system expects the root element of the
configuration file to be a tag of the kind
`<element name="root_element_name">`, i.e. the value of the name
attribute of the root tag must match the name of the root element in the
data file. Otherwise, the system will not perform the output. That is,
if the data file has the following structure

[source,xml]
----
<root>
    ...
</root>
----

then the configuration file must look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<element name="root">
    ...
</element>
----

All the other `<element>` tags must also have the *name* attribute.

In element reading mode, the system reads the child tags of the
`<element>` tag from the descriptor file. They can belong to one of
the following types: `<output>` and `<iteration>` The system switches to
output mode or iteration mode respectively. There can be any number of
`<output>` and `<iteration>` child tags in the `<element>` tag, and
they can go in any order, since the system processes them in sequence,
one after another.

The *name* attribute supports the following values:

1.  Direct specification of the *tag name*. In this case, the
interpreter starts to process `<element>` only if the tag name in the
scanned data file matches the one specified in the attribute.
2.  *** value (asterisk). In this case, any tag in the data file is
suitable for processing.
3.  A simple XQuery expression of type *tagname[@attribute='value']*.
Processing occurs only when the tag name matches the tag name *value*,
and the attribute value equals *value*. NOTE: we only support
expressions of this type, with a single attribute and the "= " sign. The
`<, >` characters, and Boolean expressions with multiple conditions WILL
NOT work. Only a tagName[@attribute='value'] expression will work
(quotes can be single or double, depending on the circumstances, using
*"* is also allowed).
4.  *(before)* and *(after)* values. They are used to output a
"prologue" and "epilogue" of a sequence of elements.

[[iteration-mode]]
==== Iteration Mode

In iteration mode the system works as follows:

* The context value of the current data item is remembered in order to
restore it after the iteration is completed.
* Then, depending on the value of the *index* attribute:
** If the `<iteration>` tag does not have an *index* attribute, all
subelements of the current element of data document are read, and each
of them is set as the current one successively.
** If the `<iteration>` tag has an *index* attribute, it is read, and
set as the current specific subelement of the current element. The value
of the *index* attribute can be an integer starting from zero.
* After the next current element is read and set, the system
sequentially reads all subelements of the `<iteration>` tag, which can
only be of the `<element>` type.
* If the `<element>` tag with the name=”(before)" attribute is
encountered, then the parent data element is processed first, making it
possible to output the “header” of the elements sequence.
* If the value of the name attribute of the `<element>` tag matches with
the name of the current element (or the name attribute is set to '*'),
the system switches to the element reading mode described above.
* If the `<element>` tag with the name=”(after)" attribute is
encountered, the parent data element is processed last, making it
possible to output the “footer” of the elements sequence.
* `<iteration>` tag can have a *mode* attribute, setting the mode of
template fragments composition in the output file. Possible values are:
** no value – the template fragments that are presented in output mode
are arranged from top to bottom in the resulting document.
** *horizontal* – template fragments are arranged from left to right in
the resulting document.
* The `<iteration>` tag can have a *merge* attribute. If the integer
value of this attribute is greater than zero and equals N, then the N
first columns (or N first rows, depending on the vertical or horizontal
mode) of the iteration-formed block will be merged into one cell. It is
useful for building reports in which the merged cell must cover an
alternating number of rows or columns.
* The `<iteration>` tag can have the *regionName* attribute. If this
attribute is set, then the iteration-formed block at the end of the
iteration will be converted to a named range with the specified name.
* After the iteration is completed, the system restores the context
value of the current element for subelements that started the iteration.

Since there can be any number of `<iteration>` tags inside the
`<element>` tag and any number of `<element>` tags inside the
`<iteration>` tag, this allows you to flexibly organize complex
traversals of the data file. For example, if the data file has the
following structure:

[source,xml]
----
<root>
    <a></a>
    <a></a>
    <b></b>
    <a></a>
    <b></b>
    <b></b>
    <a></a>
</root>
----

— i.e, inside the root element, the `<a>` and `<b>` tags go in random
order, then in order to process `<a>` and `<b>` tags in the same
sequence as they go in the data file, the configuration file should look
like:

[source,yaml]
---
name: root
output-steps:
- iteration:
    element:
    - name: a
    - name: b

or

[source,yaml]
---
name: root
output-steps:
- iteration:
    element:
    - name: "*"
and in order to process all the `<a>` tags first, and then all the `<b>`
tags

[source,yaml]
---
name: root
output-steps:
- iteration:
    element:
    - name: a
- iteration:
    element:
    - name: b

In order to process the zero and then the first tag, regardless of the
names of these tags, the configuration file should look like this:

[source,yaml]
---
name: root
output-steps:
- iteration:
    index: 0
    element:
    - name: "*"
- iteration:
    index: 1
    element:
    - name: "*"

[[output-mode]]
==== Output Mode

When the system switches to output mode, it copies a template fragment
to a specific location in the resulting file, and fills that fragment
with data based on the current data file element. The `<output>` tags
can only be found inside the `<element>` tag, but there can be as many
of them as you want, and they can go in random order mixed with the
`<iteration>` tags. The attributes of the `<output >` tag are

* **sourcesheet** — an optional attribute that points to the template
workbook sheet from which the output range is taken. If not specified,
the current (last used) sheet is used.
* **range** – an optional attribute, template range, that is copied to
the resulting document, for example “A1:M10”, or “5:6”, or “C:C”. Usage
of ranges of rows like “5:6” in left-to-right output mode or of column
ranges like “C:C” in top-to-bottom output mode will cause an error.
* **worksheet** – an optional attribute. If it is defined, a new sheet
is created in the output file, and the output position is moved to the
A1 cell of that sheet. If you define a value for this attribute that is
equal to a constant or XPath expression, the sheet name is substituted
from that constant or the result of the expression.
* ** repeatingcols**, **repeatingrows ** — optional attributes that go
together with the *worksheet* attribute. They set the header/footer
(repeated on each sheet) columns/rows for a new sheet. The values should
be specified in the "1:2" format with numeration starting from ZERO (for
example, to repeat the first line on each page, you must set
repeatingrows=" 0: 0")
* *pagebreak* — if this attribute is present as `pagebreak="true"`, the
output of the next section of the report will start with a new page. _In
this case, if the current output mode is from top to bottom, then a
horizontal page break is formed, and if it is from left to right, then a
vertical page break is created._ Sometimes “widow” and “orphan” lines  in the report are unacceptable (this often relates to the footer  elements
with the results and signatures). If the Xylophone report is created for
instant printing (without manual adjustment), the pagination should be
performed correctly at once.

[[representative-example]]
=== Representative Example

Let’s say we need a report consisting of a title sheet and
several section sheets (names of those are defined by input data). Suppose
the title sheet has a hierarchical list of elements that belong to
different levels and require different render.

image::pic1.png[]

There may be any amount of sections, this is specified by the input
data. Those sections contain tables with different numbers of lines and
columns:

image::pic2.png[]

Data presented in the XML file has the following structure:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<report>
    <titlepage>
        <line name="Line 1" value="10"/>
        <group name = "Line 2" value = "23">
            <line name = "Line 2.1" value="30"/>
            <line name = "Line 2.2" value="92"/>
        </group>
        <line name = "Line 3" value="11"/>
    </titlepage>
    <sheet name="Section A">
        <column name="2009"/>
        <column name="2010"/>
        <column name="2011"/>
        <row name="Item 1">
            <cell value = "1"/>
            <cell value = "33"/>
            <cell value = "34"/>
        </row>
        <row name="Item 2">
            <cell value = "93"/>
            <cell value = "9"/>
            <cell value = "1"/>
        </row>
        <row name="Item 3">
            <cell value = "1"/>
            <cell value = "50"/>
            <cell value = "2"/>
        </row>
    </sheet>
    <sheet name="Section B">

    </sheet>
</report>
----

In this case the template containing layout and substitutionfields for
the title sheet and sections might look like this:

image::pic3.png[]

Substitution fields have the following format:

```
~{Xpath-expression}
```

(tilde, opening curly brace, Xpath expression relative to the current XML
context, closing brace)

WARNING: The key to creating reports via Xylophone successfully is writing
correct Xpath expressions. Those expressions are extracting data from
current XML file’s context; if you’re not familiar with Xpath you can
learn more about it here
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp[[1]].

Besides standard syntax you can also use some specific functions in
XPath expression:

* *current()* — will be replaced with a full XPath expression to the
current node during extraction. It is a full analogue of the XSLT’s
current() function, essential for complex XPath expressions. The
presence of this function is justified for the same reasons as in XSLT’s
current() (please refer to XSLT’s documentation on current() and its
distinction from . (dot)).
* *position()* — an iteration number. Will be replaced with the number
of a current iteration during extraction. Helps with simple sequential
numeration of steps in the report (you can use it instead of placing
numeration to file’s tags).

Please note that the template may contain some illustrative information
that won’t end up in the resulting document. It’s a good practice to
provide some explaining information in your template, making further
improvements easier.

The descriptor file managing the XML traverse might look like this:

[source,yaml]
---
output-steps:
- iteration:
    element:
    - output-steps:
      - output:
          worksheet: Title

          - output-steps:

            - output:
                range: A11
                sourcesheet: src
          - output-steps:
            - output:
                range: B11
                sourcesheet: src
      - iteration:
          element:
          - output-steps:
            - iteration:
                mode: horizontal
                element:
                - output-steps:
                  - output:
                      range: A12
                - output-steps:
                  - output:
                      range: B12

[[the-sax-mode-for-huge-reports]]
=== The SAX Mode For Huge Reports

The SAX mode is suitable for the situations requiring to form reports from
tremendous data input quickly. This mode suggests that data file never
loads into memory fully, and the resulting file formation is managed by
the SAX events with increased processing speed and saving memory,
allowing the system to process huge amounts of data. You can choose the
SAX mode in Xylophone’s launch parameters, as the DOM mode is set by
default. The SAX mode implies those structure limitations:

1.  Just one `<iteration>` tag inside every `<element>` tag.
2.  XPath links can point only to the current element’s attributes;
position() function is supported.

If you restructure your XML data file this way, you can have point 1 and
2 executed for a wide range of tasks — for example, you can easily
restructure XML for the “representative example”.

[[stage-2-formation-of-pdf-files-and-output-for-printing]]
== Phase 2. Output to PDF files and printer

Using the Excel2Print module you can converse the resulting Excel report
into a PDF file or send it for printing right away.

WARNING: Please note that you can process only XLS files this way, the system
does not support XLSX-to-PDF processing yet.

WARNING: The system is not capable of outputting to PDF/printer any
picture, shapes and charts, and in the nearest time that won’t be an option.
